# Congratulations

<p>You have just built Linux From Scratch and ready to move onto customizing it for you the next packages
will allow you to build upto a usable desktop and allow you to use dosbox to play some games</p>

<p>I started with the Alsa Lib to make sure I had the sound configured and working, Then proceeded with
security and adding a user, as well as all the Python Dependencies.</p>
